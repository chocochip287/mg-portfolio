Work in progress. Not in a release state as of 9/22. Still playing catch up from losing more than a week to COVID.

In its current rough draft state I have borders around nearly every main tag in order to make it easier to see what my CSS modifications are doing to the finished product. Right now the plan is for the project image links to be the only borders left on the final product since the plan is to have an overlay on top of the images with a title for the project and a list of the technologies/skills used on each.

This README will also be heavily revised and updated in the final product for a regrade submission.
